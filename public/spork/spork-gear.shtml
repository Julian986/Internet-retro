<h2>How do I get my hands on this cool spork gear?</h2>

For US$7+S&amp;H you can get yourself a quality spork shirt. It will
have a never before seen 3d spork graphic on the front and the slogan
``I saw some guy trying to eat ramen with a spork at
http://www.spork.org/'' and an image on the front.

<hr>
<p>First, you should fill out this order form. But since at the moment
I have no selection, just mail $7 + $2 S&amp;H for each shirt you want
to the address below.

Do not do this. There are no shirts. This site is 20 years old. What's
wrong with you?


</p><p>
As I recieve money, I'll make the shirts.
</p><hr>

<a name="cost-info"><h2>Hey! $7! How much are you making?</h2></a>
<p>Nothing (At $7 bucks, how much could I possibly be making?). In fact, 
when  S&amp;H fits in I'll be at a loss for some people. Unfortuantely, 
the shirts are of only medium stock, and the decal is nothing more than 
iron-on (but iron-oned with love dammit! Love!), if you want something 
more durable, You can send me $24 (Which is out and out highway robbery! 
If you know someplace that does silkscreening on the cheap, please tell 
me).
